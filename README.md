"# styledKeyboardWebsite"


Hi there, 

This is a previous basic website design I made that introduces a light-up keyboard. I've added styling to all the elements in the previous HTML files and added a few tweaks to the original HTML code so that I could call upon them in my external CSS file. 

I've also added the CSS file to this repository. 

Feel free to reach out if there are any questions regarding my code,
